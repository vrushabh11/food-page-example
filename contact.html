Restaurant Guru is a restaurant aggregator. We provide users with the complete information on restaurants. This info is collected from popular agencies (Michelin, Frommer's, Zagat, Zomato, Yelp, Google, Foursquare, Facebook) and updated on Restaurant Guru as soon as it gets refreshed on their pages. We're working to help people choose the right place to eat at.<br><br>
